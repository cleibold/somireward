Original spike times are contained in

decoding_data__Expert.npy and decoding_data__Non-expert.npy

They are loaded in `../decoding_analysis.ipynb` and contain python dictionaries for each SOMI unit.

Each of these dicts contain the recorded spike time steps of the unit with the key 'spikes', e.g.

spikes = data_d['spikes'] # spike time steps
